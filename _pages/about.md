I am a current Ph.D. student at Arizona State University advised by YooJung Choi. I spend most of my research time working on better understanding probabilistic models. Currently I am interested in studying the tractability of approximate modeling and learning probabilistic circuits, using tools from approximate knowledge compilation to explore and characterize the computational challenges associated with learning probabilistic circuits. Before ASU I completed a Masters degree in Statistics and a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Northern Arizona University.
