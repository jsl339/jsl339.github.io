TLDR: We investigate the hardness of approximating distributions with TPMs. Our main results show
the NP-hardness of approximation with a bounded f-divergence for any model which can tractably marginalize,
and an exponential lower bound on the size of a deterministic, decomposable probabilisitic circuit representing a 
distribution exactly encoded by a decomposable probabilistic circuit. We also have a number of results related to bounded f-divergence
and approximate inference guarantees.
